[Chestnut](https://github.com/plexus/chestnut) is one of the coolest
bits of ClojureScript tech I've encountered in a very long time. Rather
than wax poetic I'm just going to show a short video of Chestnut in
action. In the following you'll see several novel things including a very
stable ClojureScript REPL based on WebSockets - always ready to go even
if you kill the web server, refresh the web page, or have a JS exception
on the page. You'll also see live updating of the running application
without corrupting the application state in the style of
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org):

Big shout outs to [Bruce Hauman](https://twitter.com/bhauman) for
[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), [Tom
Jakubowski](https://github.com/tomjakubowski) for
[Weasel](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/weasel) and [Arne
Brasseur](https://twitter.com/plexus) for putting it all together.

Happy hacking!
