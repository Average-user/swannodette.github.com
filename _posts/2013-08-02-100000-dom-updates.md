<style>
table {
    margin-left: 45px;
    font-family: courier;
    font-size: 8px;
    line-height: 1em !important;
}
.group0 {
    color: #000
}
.group1 {
    color: #f00
}
.group2 {
    color: #0f0
}

</style>

Click the table of zeroes many times. Note that the text input field
remains responsive even as we update 100,000 DOM elements one by one
over and over again. The colors of the table show the render batching
boundaries. Note, I would not try this on a mobile device ;)

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    <input />
</div>
<table id="big-table" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"></table>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/csp3.js"></script>

The following is all the code we need to write a batching render with
a flush in milliseconds set by `rate`. We've intentionally set a small
buffer size, as we increase the buffer size the table will update in
larger and larger chunks.

```
(defn render-loop [rate]
  (let [in (chan 1)]
    (go (loop [refresh (timeout rate) queue []]
          (let [[v c] (alts! [refresh in])]
            (condp = c
              refresh (do (render! queue)
                        (recur (timeout rate) []))
              in (recur refresh (conj queue v))))))
    in))
```

Fun stuff.
