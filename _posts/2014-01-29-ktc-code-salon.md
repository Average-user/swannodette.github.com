I normally don't make geographically specific announcements on this
blog, but for this once I am making an exception. While the New York
technology meetup scene is quite vibrant, for me personally there's
something missing and with the help of
[Kitchen Table Coders](kitchentablecoders.com), we've decided to
actually do something about it - **KTC Code Salon**.

If you don't know, Kitchen Table Coders is a loose collective of
un-like-minded hackers both software and hardware, artists, builders,
musicians, and educators that share a studio space in Brooklyn. You're
just as likely to find us tinkering with an
[Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) as you are to find us discussing the
finer points of programming language design. It's a refreshing break
from the homogeneity of any one particular meetup group. In many
respects it's this intellectual diversity that's make me love places
like [Hacker School](hackerschool.com) and conferences like
[Strange Loop](thestrangeloop).

So what is **KTC Code Salon** exactly? It's a monthly meetup curated
by yours truly in attempt to bring some the excitement you find at
well run conferences into the comfort of Brooklyn. We bring talented
speakers to present original technical content in an intimate
atmosphere where both the speaker and the audience will feel
stimulated and challenged. Talks will always be limited to forty
minutes with ample room for discussion, friendly debate, collaborative
hacking, and perhaps a [Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)
match or two.
