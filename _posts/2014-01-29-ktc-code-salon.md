I normally don't make geographically specific announcements on this
blog, but for this once I am making an exception. While the New York
technology meetup scene is quite vibrant, for me personally there's
something missing and with the help of
[Kitchen Table Coders](http://kitchentablecoders.com), we've decided to
actually do something about it - **KTC Code Salon**.

If you don't know, Kitchen Table Coders is a loose collective of
un-like-minded hackers both software and hardware, artists, builders,
musicians, and educators that share a studio space in Brooklyn. You're
just as likely to find us discussing the finer points of drawing as
you are the finer points of programming language design. It's a
eye-opening break from the focused community building which is so
necessary for more topical meetup groups. While I like meetups just as
much as anyone, I've found that it's the explicit cultivation of diversity
that makes me love places like [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com) and
conferences like [Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com).

So what is **KTC Code Salon** exactly? It's a monthly gathering curated
by yours truly in an attempt to bring some of the excitement you find at
well run conferences into the comfort of Brooklyn. We bring talented
speakers to present original technical content in an intimate
atmosphere where we hope both the speaker and the audience will feel
stimulated and challenged. Talks will always be limited to forty
minutes with ample room for discussion, friendly debate, collaborative
hacking, and perhaps a heated [Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo)
match or two. We charge a small fee for attendees to cover the space,
setup, and beer in exchange for what we believe will be a uniquely
invigorating space of ideas. Seating is very limited so grab a spot
for the speakers you want to see! If you're speaker who might be
visiting New York this year, get in touch!

For more details refer to our official
[post](http://kitchentablecoders.com/event/2014/02/12/code-salon). We'll be
announcing our first set of speakers in the next week or so.

Stay tuned.
