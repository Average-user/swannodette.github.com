As [ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) matures
there's a growing community interest in understanding how
ClojureScript analysis and compilation works. I've put together a
[repository]() and a [screencast]() using
[Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/) that you can follow
along. The material is based on a talk I gave a while back at
[Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/).

Enjoy.
