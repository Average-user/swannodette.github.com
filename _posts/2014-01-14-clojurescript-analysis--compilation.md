Without a doubt [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/) is now the
most popular [ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
application in the world. It's also likely one of the most complex at
around 11,000 lines of ClojureScript. 

I think Light Tablers looking to extend their shiny new environment
might first consider reaching for JavaScript. I challenge them to give
ClojureScript a very serious consideration before doing so.

To encourage users of Light Table, Clojure, and ClojureScript to get
to know their tool better, I've put together an
[interactive guide to the ClojureScript analyzer and compiler](http://github.com/swannodette/hello-cljsc).

I think exploring a compiler should always be this simple and
interactive.

Enjoy.
