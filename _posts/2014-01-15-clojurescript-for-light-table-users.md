I'm putting together an
[interactive ClojureScript tutorial for Light Table users](http://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial). You
can go through the tutorial by *directly evaluating* forms in the file
via the Light Table UI Connection.

I hope this can be a collaborative wiki for those people who want to
extend their editor with an extremely capable and powerful programming
language.
